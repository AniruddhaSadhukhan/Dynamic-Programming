# Given a value N, if we want to make change for N cents, 
# and we have infinite supply of each of S = { S1, S2, .. , Sm} valued coins,
# how many ways can we make the change? The order of coins doesnâ€™t matter.

# For example, for N = 4 and S = {1,2,3}, there are four solutions: 
# {1,1,1,1},{1,1,2},{2,2},{1,3}. So output should be 4.
# For N = 10 and S = {2, 5, 3, 6}, there are five solutions: 
# {2,2,2,2,2}, {2,2,3,3}, {2,2,6}, {2,3,5} and {5,5}.
# So the output should be 5.

# Logic: Similar to Count of Subset with given sum problem but for unbounded Knapsack
