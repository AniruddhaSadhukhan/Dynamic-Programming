# Given two strings str1 and str2, find the length of shortest string
# that has both str1 and str2 as subsequences.

# Examples :

# Input:   str1 = "geek",  str2 = "eke"
# Output: 5 ("geeke")

# Input:   str1 = "AGGTAB",  str2 = "GXTXAYB"
# Output:  9 ("AGXGTXAYB")

# Logic: We need to find a string that has both strings as subsequences
# and is shortest such string. If both strings have all characters different,
# then result is sum of lengths of two given strings. If there are common characters,
# then we donâ€™t want them multiple times as the task is to minimize length.
# Therefore, we fist find the longest common subsequence, take one occurrence
# of this subsequence and add extra characters.


# Length of the shortest supersequence  = (Sum of lengths of given two strings) -
#                                         (Length of LCS of two given strings)
