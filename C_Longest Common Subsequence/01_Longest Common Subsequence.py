# LCS Problem Statement: Given two sequences, find the length of longest subsequence present in both of them.
# A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous.
# For example, “abc”, “abg”, “bdf”, “aeg”, ‘”acefg”, .. etc are subsequences of “abcdefg”.

# Examples:
# LCS for input Sequences “ABCDGH” and “AEDFHR” is “ADH” of length 3.
# LCS for input Sequences “AGGTAB” and “GXTXAYB” is “GTAB” of length 4.
